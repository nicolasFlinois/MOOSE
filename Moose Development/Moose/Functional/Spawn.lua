--- # SPAWN class, extends @{Base#BASE}
-- 
-- The SPAWN class allows to spawn dynamically new groups.  
-- Each SPAWN object needs to be have a related **template group** setup in the Mission Editor (ME),
-- which is a normal group with the **Late Activation** flag set. 
-- This template group will never be activated in your mission.  
-- SPAWN uses that **template group** to reference to all the characteristics 
-- (air, ground, livery, unit composition, formation, skill level etc) of each new group to be spawned.  
-- 
-- Therefore, when creating a SPAWN object, the @{#SPAWN.New} and @{#SPAWN.NewWithAlias} require
-- **the name of the template group** to be given as a string to those constructor methods.  
--  
-- Initialization settings can be applied on the SPAWN object, 
-- which modify the behaviour or the way groups are spawned.
-- These initialization methods have the prefix **Init**.
-- There are also spawn methods with the prefix **Spawn** and will spawn new groups in various ways.
-- 
-- ### IMPORTANT! The methods with prefix **Init** must be used before any methods with prefix **Spawn** method are used, or unexpected results may appear!!!  
-- 
-- Because SPAWN can spawn multiple groups of a template group, 
-- SPAWN has an **internal index** that keeps track 
-- which was the latest group that was spawned.  
-- 
-- **Limits** can be set on how many groups can be spawn in each SPAWN object, 
-- using the method @{#SPAWN.InitLimit}. SPAWN has 2 kind of limits:
-- 
--   * The maximum amount of @{Unit}s that can be **alive** at the same time... 
--   * The maximum amount of @{Group}s that can be **spawned**... This is more of a **resource**-type of limit.
--   
-- When new groups get spawned using the **Spawn** methods, 
-- it will be evaluated whether any limits have been reached.
-- When no spawn limit is reached, a new group will be created by the spawning methods, 
-- and the internal index will be increased with 1.  
-- 
-- These limits ensure that your mission does not accidentally get flooded with spawned groups.  
-- Additionally, it also guarantees that independent of the group composition, 
-- at any time, the most optimal amount of groups are alive in your mission.
-- For example, if your template group has a group composition of 10 units, and you specify a limit of 100 units alive at the same time,
-- with unlimited resources = :InitLimit( 100, 0 ) and 10 groups are alive, but two groups have only one unit alive in the group,
-- then a sequent Spawn(Scheduled) will allow a new group to be spawned!!!
-- 
-- ### IMPORTANT!! If a limit has been reached, it is possible that a **Spawn** method returns **nil**, meaning, no @{Group} had been spawned!!!  
-- 
-- Spawned groups get **the same name** as the name of the template group.  
-- Spawned units in those groups keep _by default_ **the same name** as the name of the template group.  
-- However, because multiple groups and units are created from the template group, 
-- a suffix is added to each spawned group and unit.
-- 
-- Newly spawned groups will get the following naming structure at run-time:
-- 
--   1. Spawned groups will have the name _GroupName_#_nnn_, where _GroupName_ is the name of the **template group**, 
--   and _nnn_ is a **counter from 0 to 999**.
--   2. Spawned units will have the name _GroupName_#_nnn_-_uu_, 
--   where _uu_ is a **counter from 0 to 99** for each new spawned unit belonging to the group.
-- 
-- That being said, there is a way to keep the same unit names!  
-- The method @{#SPAWN.InitKeepUnitNames}() will keep the same unit names as defined within the template group, thus:
-- 
--   3. Spawned units will have the name _UnitName_#_nnn_-_uu_, 
--   where _UnitName_ is the **unit name as defined in the template group*, 
--   and _uu_ is a **counter from 0 to 99** for each new spawned unit belonging to the group.
-- 
-- Some **additional notes that need to be considered!!**:
-- 
--   * templates are actually groups defined within the mission editor, with the flag "Late Activation" set. 
--   As such, these groups are never used within the mission, but are used by the @{#SPAWN} module.
--   * It is important to defined BEFORE you spawn new groups, 
--   a proper initialization of the SPAWN instance is done with the options you want to use.
--   * When designing a mission, NEVER name groups using a "#" within the name of the group Spawn template(s), 
--   or the SPAWN module logic won't work anymore.
--   
-- ## SPAWN construction methods
-- 
-- Create a new SPAWN object with the @{#SPAWN.New}() or the @{#SPAWN.NewWithAlias}() methods:
-- 
--   * @{#SPAWN.New}(): Creates a new SPAWN object taking the name of the group that represents the GROUP template (definition).
--   * @{#SPAWN.NewWithAlias}(): Creates a new SPAWN object taking the name of the group that represents the GROUP template (definition), and gives each spawned @{Group} an different name.
--
-- It is important to understand how the SPAWN class works internally. The SPAWN object created will contain internally a list of groups that will be spawned and that are already spawned.
-- The initialization methods will modify this list of groups so that when a group gets spawned, ALL information is already prepared when spawning. This is done for performance reasons.
-- So in principle, the group list will contain all parameters and configurations after initialization, and when groups get actually spawned, this spawning can be done quickly and efficient.
--
-- ## SPAWN **Init**ialization methods
-- 
-- A spawn object will behave differently based on the usage of **initialization** methods, which all start with the **Init** prefix:  
-- 
-- ### Unit Names
-- 
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitKeepUnitNames}(): Keeps the unit names as defined within the mission editor, but note that anything after a # mark is ignored, and any spaces before and after the resulting name are removed. IMPORTANT! This method MUST be the first used after :New !!!
-- 
-- ### Route randomization
-- 
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitRandomizeRoute}(): Randomize the routes of spawned groups, and for air groups also optionally the height.
--   
-- ### Group composition randomization  
--   
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitRandomizeTemplate}(): Randomize the group templates so that when a new group is spawned, a random group template is selected from one of the templates defined. 
-- 
-- ### Uncontrolled
-- 
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitUnControlled}(): Spawn plane groups uncontrolled.
-- 
-- ### Array formation
--   
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitArray}(): Make groups visible before they are actually activated, and order these groups like a batallion in an array.
-- 
-- ### Position randomization
-- 
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitRandomizePosition}(): Randomizes the position of @{Group}s that are spawned within a **radius band**, given an Outer and Inner radius, from the point that the spawn happens.
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitRandomizeUnits}(): Randomizes the @{Unit}s in the @{Group} that is spawned within a **radius band**, given an Outer and Inner radius.
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitRandomizeZones}(): Randomizes the spawning between a predefined list of @{Zone}s that are declared using this function. Each zone can be given a probability factor.
--   
-- ### Enable / Disable AI when spawning a new @{Group}
--   
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitAIOn}(): Turns the AI On when spawning the new @{Group} object.
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitAIOff}(): Turns the AI Off when spawning the new @{Group} object.
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitAIOnOff}(): Turns the AI On or Off when spawning the new @{Group} object.
-- 
-- ### Limit scheduled spawning  
--   
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitLimit}(): Limits the amount of groups that can be alive at the same time and that can be dynamically spawned.
--   
-- ### Delay initial scheduled spawn
-- 
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitDelayOnOff}(): Turns the inital delay On/Off when scheduled spawning the first @{Group} object.
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitDelayOn}(): Turns the inital delay On when scheduled spawning the first @{Group} object.
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitDelayOff}(): Turns the inital delay Off when scheduled spawning the first @{Group} object.
-- 
-- ### Repeat spawned @{Group}s upon landing
-- 
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitRepeat}() or @{#SPAWN.InitRepeatOnLanding}(): This method is used to re-spawn automatically the same group after it has landed.
--   * @{#SPAWN.InitRepeatOnEngineShutDown}(): This method is used to re-spawn automatically the same group after it has landed and it shuts down the engines at the ramp.
-- 
-- 
-- ## SPAWN **Spawn** methods
-- 
-- Groups can be spawned at different times and methods:
-- 
-- ### **Single** spawning methods
-- 
--   * @{#SPAWN.Spawn}(): Spawn one new group based on the last spawned index.
--   * @{#SPAWN.ReSpawn}(): Re-spawn a group based on a given index.
--   * @{#SPAWN.SpawnFromVec3}(): Spawn a new group from a Vec3 coordinate. (The group will can be spawned at a point in the air).
--   * @{#SPAWN.SpawnFromVec2}(): Spawn a new group from a Vec2 coordinate. (The group will be spawned at land height ).
--   * @{#SPAWN.SpawnFromStatic}(): Spawn a new group from a structure, taking the position of a @{Static}.
--   * @{#SPAWN.SpawnFromUnit}(): Spawn a new group taking the position of a @{Unit}.
--   * @{#SPAWN.SpawnInZone}(): Spawn a new group in a @{Zone}.
-- 
-- Note that @{#SPAWN.Spawn} and @{#SPAWN.ReSpawn} return a @{GROUP#GROUP.New} object, that contains a reference to the DCSGroup object. 
-- You can use the @{GROUP} object to do further actions with the DCSGroup.
-- 
-- ### **Scheduled** spawning methods
-- 
--   * @{#SPAWN.SpawnScheduled}(): Spawn groups at scheduled but randomized intervals. 
--   * @{#SPAWN.SpawnScheduledStart}(): Start or continue to spawn groups at scheduled time intervals. 
--   * @{#SPAWN.SpawnScheduledStop}(): Stop the spawning of groups at scheduled time intervals. 
-- 
-- 
--  
-- ## Retrieve alive GROUPs spawned by the SPAWN object
-- 
-- The SPAWN class administers which GROUPS it has reserved (in stock) or has created during mission execution.
-- Every time a SPAWN object spawns a new GROUP object, a reference to the GROUP object is added to an internal table of GROUPS.
-- SPAWN provides methods to iterate through that internal GROUP object reference table:
-- 
--   * @{#SPAWN.GetFirstAliveGroup}(): Will find the first alive GROUP it has spawned, and return the alive GROUP object and the first Index where the first alive GROUP object has been found.
--   * @{#SPAWN.GetNextAliveGroup}(): Will find the next alive GROUP object from a given Index, and return a reference to the alive GROUP object and the next Index where the alive GROUP has been found.
--   * @{#SPAWN.GetLastAliveGroup}(): Will find the last alive GROUP object, and will return a reference to the last live GROUP object and the last Index where the last alive GROUP object has been found.
-- 
-- You can use the methods @{#SPAWN.GetFirstAliveGroup}() and sequently @{#SPAWN.GetNextAliveGroup}() to iterate through the alive GROUPS within the SPAWN object, and to actions... See the respective methods for an example.
-- The method @{#SPAWN.GetGroupFromIndex}() will return the GROUP object reference from the given Index, dead or alive...
-- 
-- ## Spawned cleaning of inactive groups
-- 
-- Sometimes, it will occur during a mission run-time, that ground or especially air objects get damaged, and will while being damged stop their activities, while remaining alive.
-- In such cases, the SPAWN object will just sit there and wait until that group gets destroyed, but most of the time it won't, 
-- and it may occur that no new groups are or can be spawned as limits are reached.
-- To prevent this, a @{#SPAWN.InitCleanUp}() initialization method has been defined that will silently monitor the status of each spawned group.
-- Once a group has a velocity = 0, and has been waiting for a defined interval, that group will be cleaned or removed from run-time. 
-- There is a catch however :-) If a damaged group has returned to an airbase within the coalition, that group will not be considered as "lost"... 
-- In such a case, when the inactive group is cleaned, a new group will Re-spawned automatically. 
-- This models AI that has succesfully returned to their airbase, to restart their combat activities.
-- Check the @{#SPAWN.InitCleanUp}() for further info.
-- 
-- ## Catch the @{Group} Spawn Event in a callback function!
-- 
-- When using the @{#SPAWN.SpawnScheduled)() method, new @{Group}s are created following the spawn time interval parameters.
-- When a new @{Group} is spawned, you maybe want to execute actions with that group spawned at the spawn event.
-- The SPAWN class supports this functionality through the method @{#SPAWN.OnSpawnGroup}( **function( SpawnedGroup ) end ** ), 
-- which takes a function as a parameter that you can define locally. 
-- Whenever a new @{Group} is spawned, the given function is called, and the @{Group} that was just spawned, is given as a parameter.
-- As a result, your spawn event handling function requires one parameter to be declared, which will contain the spawned @{Group} object. 
-- A coding example is provided at the description of the @{#SPAWN.OnSpawnGroup}( **function( SpawnedGroup ) end ** ) method.
-- 
-- ## Delay the initial spawning
-- 
-- When using the @{#SPAWN.SpawnScheduled)() method, the default behaviour of this method will be that it will spawn the initial (first) @{Group}
-- immediately when :SpawnScheduled() is initiated. The methods @{#SPAWN.InitDelayOnOff}() and @{#SPAWN.InitDelayOn}() can be used to
-- activate a delay before the first @{Group} is spawned. For completeness, a method @{#SPAWN.InitDelayOff}() is also available, that
-- can be used to switch off the initial delay. Because there is no delay by default, this method would only be used when a 
-- @{#SPAWN.SpawnScheduledStop}() ; @{#SPAWN.SpawnScheduledStart}() sequence would have been used.
